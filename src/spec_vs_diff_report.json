REQ-24 is not met: escape responses still use conflicting descriptors (“dark latex form”) and are not aligned with the requested black wolf + puffy fur + hard mask depiction.",

      "requirement": "Puro’s general (non-escape) replies are consistently in-character as a kind, book-reading black wolf with puffy fur and a hard mask; physical description is internally consistent and non-contradictory; fully in-universe.",
      "reason": "The new default reply includes contradictory/undesired physical traits (e.g., “latex mask”) and does not clearly reflect the specified black wolf/puffy fur/hard mask traits consistently.",
