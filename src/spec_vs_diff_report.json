  "summary": "REQ-18 frontend copy updates appear implemented (empty state and header/subtitle now neutral and still mention the \"*\" action convention). REQ-17 backend changes partially implemented: action parsing/storage is preserved and action replies are neutral, but dialogue replies are not a neutral/helpful assistant response—they simply echo the user’s input.",

      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Backend assistant should produce neutral, helpful conversational replies for normal dialogue messages (not roleplay/in-character), while preserving existing action parsing/handling.",
      "reason": "The new dialogue-path response generator returns the user’s text unchanged (echo), rather than generating a neutral/helpful assistant reply. This does not meet the requirement to shift responses to a neutral chat-assistant style.",
